description: "The young Irish social entrepreneur Adam Harris was diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome at five years old. Drawing on his experiences, he founded AsIAm, an organization that supports people with autism and educates institutions and the general public to become more sensitive about the condition. Through media appearances, awareness-building events, and the recent RTÉ documentary Autism and Me, Adam has launched a national conversation in Ireland. "
