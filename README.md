The [autisme.github.io](https://autisme.github.io/) website is dedicated to try and get a better understanding of autism in the society, especially in France, where awareness and understanding is mostly the exception rather the norm.
We present not only the challenges the people with autism face but also the qualities and capacities people with autism can bring to society.

We also give some practical tools to include these people.

Feel free to contribute !
